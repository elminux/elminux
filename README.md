# Elminux

> **Local-first. Built to last.**

> A new operating system written from scratch in Rust —
> own hybrid kernel, no libc, own package manager.
> Built for constrained hardware, offline-first deployment,
> and digital sovereignty. No Linux. No GNU. No C.

## What This Is

Elminux is an experimental, from-scratch operating system targeting:

- **Modern safety** — Rust ownership model eliminates entire CVE classes at compile time
- **No legacy debt** — no POSIX, no libc, no C heritage, no 50-year-old ABI
- **Sovereignty** — verifiable, reproducible, no cloud dependency by design
- **Constrained hardware** — built to run well on minimal resources
- **Offline-first** — full functionality without internet connectivity

## Performance Philosophy

Lightweight and fast are not automatic — they are earned at every layer.

Elminux has structural advantages: no GC, no runtime, no libc bloat, no
legacy ABI translation, purpose-built allocator, and a clean syscall ABI.
These are necessary but not sufficient.

The IPC-based driver architecture trades some latency for isolation. Fast
requires deliberate design. Every layer has an explicit performance target:

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| IPC round-trip latency | < 500ns (kernel↔driver) |
| Syscall overhead | < 200ns |
| Boot to shell (QEMU) | < 2s |
| Idle memory footprint | < 16MB |
| Kernel binary size | < 1MB |

These targets are benchmarked explicitly at v0.3.0 and tracked on every
release. Missing a target is a bug, not a footnote.

This is not a Linux distribution. This is not a fork of anything.

## Architecture Summary

| Component | Approach |
|---|---|
| Kernel | Hybrid Rust kernel (trusted core in kernel space, drivers in user space) |
| libc | None — own `elminux-std` Rust-native standard library |
| Syscall ABI | Custom capability-based ABI, defined in `elminux-syscall` |
| Package manager | `epkg` — Rust-native, TOML manifests, cryptographically signed |
| Init system | `elinit` — Rust, capability-aware |
| Shell | `modsh` — Rust, POSIX-compatible + structured I/O pipelines (Apache-2.0 core) |
| Boot | Limine bootloader → Elminux kernel entry |
| Primary target | x86_64 (QEMU first, then bare metal) |

## Current Status

`v0.1.0-alpha` — Scaffold / Pre-development

**Nothing boots yet.** This is the governance and architecture foundation.
First milestone: boot to kernel entry in QEMU.

It is not suitable for any production purpose at this stage.
Breaking changes at every layer are expected and intentional.
